`Data types`
1. String Data Type: `The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters`

```js 
var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes
var a = "Let's have a cup of coffee."; // single quote inside double quotes
var b = 'He said "Hello" and left.';  // double quotes inside single quotes
var c = 'We\'ll never give up.';     // escaping single quote with backslash
```
2. Number Data Type:`The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).`

  

3.Boolean Data Type:`The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc.`



4. Object Data Type:`The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.`


5. Array Data Type:`An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].`

   
    
6. Null Data Type:`This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.`


7. Undefined Data Type:`The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.`
