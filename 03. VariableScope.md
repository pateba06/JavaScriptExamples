Scenario 1:Global Scope - Defined outside of all code blocks

```js
let name ='John';   //name is declare Globally.We can call inside function or outside
if(true){
console.log(name)
}
//Output: John

```

Scenario 2: Local Scope -- Defined inside a code block
```js
let name ='John';  //global Scope
if(true){
console.log(name);
let place="USA"    //place has local scope. It can be only use inside the If function in this scenario
}
console.log(place);   // we will get error. As place has local scope inside the If function.
//Output: error
```


Scenario 3: Local Scope 
```js
let name ='John';

if(true){
console.log(name)
let place="USA"      //local scope
console.log(place)   // it will work as it calling from inside code block of local scope
}

//console.log(place)  // we will get error. As place has local scope inside the If function.
//Note:
//console.log(place) --which is inside the if block code it will work
//console.log(place) --which is Outside of if block code it wont work

```
