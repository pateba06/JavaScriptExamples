console.log(test1);
//it will return false.
```

                                Boolean using Comparision Operators
                                
                                
`=== Equality Operator: comparision will check value and data type`
```js
let age =32;
let test1 =age === 32;
console.log(test1);
//it will return true.
```

```js
let age =32;
let test1 =age === 30;
console.log(test1);
//it will return false. As the value is not same.
```


`!== Not Equal Operator`
```js
let age =32;
let test1 =age !== 30;
console.log(test1);
//it will return True. As the value is not same .
```

`< Less than Operator `
```js
let age =32;
let test1 =age < 30;
console.log(test1);
//it will return false. 
```

`> Greater than Operator `
```js
let age =32;
let test1 =age > 30;
console.log(test1);
//it will return True. 
```

`<= Less than equal Operator `
```js
let age =32;
let test1 =age <= 32;
console.log(test1);
//it will return True. As it is equal to , so satisfy one condition
```

`>= Greater than equal Operator `
```js
let age =32;
let test1 =age >= 30;
console.log(test1);
//it will return false. As it is not greater or equal
```
