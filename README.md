JS learning Guide with Examples. Creating Java script code library to learn from Basic to Advanced


Hi All,

I am not creating js file in this repository. The idea for creating .md file is easy to read , try by yourself or copy and paste and test it 
to know how it performs.

The reason to make this repo is to make a repo so somebody can learn JS concept from scratch with practical examples.
