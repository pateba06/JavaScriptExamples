              Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

* Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
* Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
* Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
* Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed


## Basic of If Structure
```js
Default Structure--we should use 
if (){
}

//If we keep true the functions inside curly brackets will always run
 if (true){
 }

//If we keep boolean type false. The code will never run.
if (false){
 }
```
 
 
 ```js
 //The code will run and print "Hello" as test1 fulfil condition age<= 32.
 //The condition is true, so the arguement in the function will be passed and run the code.
 
 let age =32;
 let test1= age <= 32;
 if (test1){
     console.log("Hello ");
 }
 
 //The code will not print "Hello" as test1 does not fulfil condition age <= 30. 
 //so as the argument is false, the function won't be performed.
  let age =32;
 let test1= age <= 30;
 if (test1){
     console.log("Hello ");
 }
 
 ```
 
 # Example of Pass or Fail...Try it yourself. Copy the code, and change marks 30 then 45 and see the result
  ```js
  let marks = 70;
  if (marks <= 40){
    console.log("fail");
  }
  if (marks > 40){
    console.log("pass");
  }
 ```
