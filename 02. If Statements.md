              Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

* Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
* Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
* Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
* Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed


**Basic If Structure**
```js
if (){
}

//If we keep true the functions inside curly brackets will always run
 if (true){
 }

//If we keep boolean type false. The code will never run.
if (false){
 }
```
 
 
 ```js
 let age =32
 let test1= age <= 32
 if (true){
 }
 ```
