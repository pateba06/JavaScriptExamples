# Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

* Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
* Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
* Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
* Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed


# Basic of If Structure
```js
Default Structure--we should use 
if (){
}

//If we keep true the functions inside curly brackets will always run
 if (true){
 }

//If we keep boolean type false. The code will never run.
if (false){
 }
```
 
 
 ```js
 //The code will run and print "Hello" as test1 fulfil condition age<= 32.
 //The condition is true, so the arguement in the function will be passed and run the code.
 
 let age =32;
 let test1= age <= 32;
 if (test1){
     console.log("Hello ");
 }
 
 //The code will not print "Hello" as test1 does not fulfil condition age <= 30. 
 //so as the argument is false, the function won't be performed.
  let age =32;
 let test1= age <= 30;
 if (test1){
     console.log("Hello ");
 }
 
 ```
 
 
 
 
 ## Example of Pass or Fail...Try it yourself. Copy the code, and change marks 30 then 45 and see the result
  ```js
  let marks = 70;
  if (marks <= 40){
    console.log("fail");
  }
  if (marks > 40){
    console.log("pass");
  }
 ```


                                    If Else Example

```js
 \\Basic structure of If Else
 if (){
 } else {
 }
```
Let see If Else simple example, so if the account is locked we will call message "Welcome" if the account is locked we will call"account is locked"

```js
\\example 1: Lets keep the isAccountLocked=true;
  
let isAccountLocked=true;
if (isAccountLocked){
  console.log("Account is Locked")
} else {
  console.log("Welcome")
}
\\the console will print Account is locked

\\example 2: Lets keept the isAccountLocked=false;
let isAccountLocked=false;
if (isAccountLocked){
  console.log("Account is Locked")
} else {
  console.log("Welcome")
}
  
```

                              Else If

The basic structure
```
if(){
} else if() {
} else {
}
```

Lets understand the scenario how it works
```js
\\Scenario 1    --the parameters inside If is True
if(true){           
//as the If condition is true it will run the code inside if and it wont go further.
} else if() {   
//it Won't run
} else {
//it Won't run
} 

\\Scenario 2    --the parameters inside If is false
if(false){           
//it won't run as the condition are not satisfied. It will go further
} else if(true) {    
//it will run as the condition is true and satisfied.
} else {
//it Won't run as it stopped at else if
} 

\\Scenario 3    --the parameters inside If and else if are false
if(false){           
//it won't run as the condition are not satisfied. It will go further
} else if(false) {    
//it won't run as the condition are not satisfied. It will go further
} else {
//it will print whatever is here as above both condition are not satisfied
} 
```

Lets see an example :
Declare two variable  
isAccountLocked=false
userRole='admin'
We want to print 'Account is locked' if account is locked.
If account is not locked then we will print 'welcome admin' if userRole=== `admin`
else it will print 'welcome' message.

```js
Scenario 1: if isAccountLocked is true..then it will only run block inside If

let isAccountLocked=true;
let userRole= 'admin'; 
if (isAccountLocked){                    //it will run the code which is inside if block and stop
  console.log("Account is Locked")
} else if(userRole==='admin') {
  console.log("Welcome admin")
} else {
  console.log("welcome")
}
  
     \\ Output:   Account is locked
     
 Scenario 2: if isAccountLocked is false..then it will go next block to else if. as userRole==='admin'
 it will only run the code inside the block of else if and it will stop here
 
 let isAccountLocked=false;
let userRole= 'admin';                     
if (isAccountLocked){                     \\condition not satisfied as false
  console.log("Account is Locked")                
} else if(userRole==='admin') {            \\it will run the code which is inside else if block as it satisfy
  console.log("Welcome admin")
} else {
  
  console.log("welcome")
}
     \\ Output: Welcome Admin
     
Scenario 3: if isAccountLocked is false and if we keep userRole==='accountant'. it would run the code which is
inside the block of else.
  
let isAccountLocked=false;  
let userRole= 'admin';
if (isAccountLocked){                      \\condition not satisfied as false
  console.log("Account is Locked")
} else if(userRole==='accountant') {       \\condition not satisfied 
  console.log("Welcome admin")
} else {                                   \\So it will run the code which is inside else block
  
  console.log("welcome")
}
  
```
