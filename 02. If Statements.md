              Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

* Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
* Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
* Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
* Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed


**Basic of If Structure**
```js
Default Structure--we should use 
if (){
}

//If we keep true the functions inside curly brackets will always run
 if (true){
 }

//If we keep boolean type false. The code will never run.
if (false){
 }
```
 
 
 ```js
 //The code will run and print "Hello" as test1 in if condition is true
 
 let age =32;
 let test1= age <= 32;
 if (test1){
 console.log("Hello ");
 }
 
 //The code will not print "Hello" as test1 does not fulfil condition so it is false in this scenario.
  let age =32;
 let test1= age <= 30;
 if (test1){
 console.log("Hello ");
 }
 
 ```
